# FitenssTrackerApp

## A webapp to store and watch workout videos, track and group workouts, and other health related things
### My first JS and webapp type project
#### Currently unfinished due to the last ~30% of the code never being commited but never pushed to github and my hard drive being subsequently erased with the project. The project was nearly completed before, but unfortunately never saw the light of day.


Using ExpresJS for the API, javascript for the backend/server, JWT for secure login, and a database to store workout and user data.
Using VueJS for the front end and premade vuetify components.
